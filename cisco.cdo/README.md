# Ansible Collection - cisco.cdo

# CISCO CDO Ansible Collection

The Ansible Cisco CDO collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the interaction with the Cisco Defense Orcestrator (CDO) platform and the devices managed by the CDO platform.

This is a work in progress and more modules and functionality will be added in subsequent releases.

## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.9.10** and should work in 2.9+

## External requirements
### Python libraries
The needed python libraries are in requirements.txt
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip3 install pycryptodome requests jmespath
```

### Cisco Defense Orcestrator API Key
This module is for interacting with the Cisco Defense Orcestrator (CDO) platform and as such the module requires a CDO API key for each CDO tenant in which the user wishes to operate. It is STRONGLY recommneded that you do NOT store your API key or other passwords in your playbooks. Use environment variables, ansible vault, or other best practices for safe password/API key usage.
