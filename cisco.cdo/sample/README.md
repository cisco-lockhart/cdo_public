# Cisco Defense Orchestrator Ansible Collection Sample Playbooks

## Notes
- The examples have hard coded values for simple demonstration, however one could just as easily store these values in inventory variables
- Passwords and API keys should NEVER be stored in clear text in inventory or playbooks. Use Ansible vaule, environment variables, or other best practices to sote passwords and API keys
